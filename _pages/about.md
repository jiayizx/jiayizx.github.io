I am a ~~first~~ second-year PhD student in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University. I am advised by Prof. [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io/) and a member of the [CHATS Lab](https://wyshi.github.io/group.html).

Previously, I was an undergraduate student at University of Michigan (UMich), with a honors major in Computer Science and two minors in Mathmatics and Linguistics. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/) at [LAUNCH Lab](https://launch.eecs.umich.edu/). I was also privileged to work closely with Prof. [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/home/).

My research interest lies on building robust and socially responsible NLP systems that align with human needs and preferences. Currently, I'm particularly interested in:

- **Social simulation**: Understanding LLMs' behavioral patterns and social reasoning in complex social scenarios.
- **Human-AI alignment**: Studying the gaps between human-human and human-AI interactions to better align LLMs with diverse human preferences and application scenarios.
