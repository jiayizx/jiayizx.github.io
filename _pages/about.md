<!-- I am a ~~first~~ second-year PhD student in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University advised by Prof. [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io/). I am also a member of the [CHATS Lab](https://wyshi.github.io/group.html). -->

<!-- Previously, I was an undergraduate student at University of Michigan (UMich), with a honors major in Computer Science and two minors in Mathmatics and Linguistics. I was fortunate to be advised by Prof. [Lu Wang](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~wangluxy/) at [LAUNCH Lab](https://launch.eecs.umich.edu/). I was also privileged to work closely with Prof. [Zhijing Jin](https://zhijing-jin.com/home/) and Prof. [Rada Mihalcea](https://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/). -->

I am a graduate student in the Khoury College of Computer Sciences at Northeastern University, previously advised by Prof. [Weiyan Shi](https://wyshi.github.io/).

My research interest lies in build AI systems that achieve bidirectional alignment with humans and can co-improve over the long term in challenging domains. Currently, I'm particularly interested in:

- Understanding and explaining complex model behaviors in human-interpretable ways (aligning Humans $\rightarrow$ AI);
- Building human-like LLM-based user simulators to bridge RL training with real-world interaction (aligning AI $\rightarrow$ Humans);
- LLMs for Scientific Discovery and multi-modal modeling and reasoning.

<mark>I am seeking a research internship for Summer 2026. Please feel free to contact me if you believe there is a potential fit.</mark>
